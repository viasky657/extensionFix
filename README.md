- **Agentic code editing** - SOTA SWE can complete complex tasks across your codebase in agentic fashion, taking multiple steps as necessary - starting from reading the right files from your codebase, making necessary changes in-place, and iterating on it's own work in case there are pending items or issues.
- **Terminal command execution** - The agent can execute terminal commands on your behalf, and can also read the output of the command as part of it's decision making process.
- **Bring your own key** - We support Claude Sonnet provided by Anthropic as well as Open Router. Just provide your API key as part of the onboarding and you are good to go.
- **Provide context** - Though not a necessary step, you can guide the agent further by providing context using `@` to specify files as part of your prompt.
