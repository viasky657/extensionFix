    <h1>SOTA SWE</h1>
</div>
 This is an experimental branch to add several new features and fix bugs so it should fix: Openrouter model:model match variable error; it will add: permission for each agent addition or change to the codebase so it will require user approval for each action, it will still have the auto approval mode, it will also have a history save and the user can see all the steps that the agent has taken and what new files were added, etc. The user may also change the temperature value for the agentic system to adjust to different models that may be used for the system which may function better at higher or lower values. This program has no warranty and is currenty being developed so use with caution. 
 
**SotaSWE is a VSCode extension built atop [the leading agentic framework](https://github.com/codestoryai/sidecar) on SWE-bench Lite.**

- **Agentic code editing** - SOTA SWE can complete complex tasks across your codebase in agentic fashion, taking multiple steps as necessary - starting from reading the right files from your codebase, making necessary changes in-place, and iterating on it's own work in case there are pending items or issues.
- **Terminal command execution** - The agent can execute terminal commands on your behalf, and can also read the output of the command as part of it's decision making process.
- **Bring your own key** - We support Claude Sonnet provided by Anthropic as well as Open Router. Just provide your API key as part of the onboarding and you are good to go.
- **Provide context** - Though not a necessary step, you can guide the agent further by providing context using `@` to specify files as part of your prompt.
